I talked with Catherine and Kayla while working on this assignment. We mainly talked about our shared experiences and some of the problems we had while writing the code. I specifically talked to Catherine about how I related to her situation because I lost a few days worth of time because my Java was not working. Eventually, I did go to TA hours and they were able to help my situation and helped a lot of the way to catch up on lost time. I went to TA hours Mon-Thurs throughout the duration of this project. 

I have worked with Java in the past so my 'initial' impressions are a bit biased. I do, however, like Java a lot more than Python because I am more familiar. I am incredibly more comfortable with Java's syntax over Python. Some similarities I can draw from coding in both languages is that both language are formulaic in the sense that they both use constructors and have set methods. The main difference that I noticed (this could be because I have explored Java more than Python) is that Java has so many ways to implement the same actions. From this project specifically, I learned that there are so many different routes to go about the same problem; sometimes they overlap and sometimes they don't.

Some things that worked for me were going to TA hours and talking to my peers. Talking with my peers didn't even help with the assignment itself, but it was comforting to know that my peers were also struggling with some of my same problems. We were able to talk through some of them which was great, but there also some that we weren't able to solve. That was okay because I went to TA hours and they really helped me to find the answer myself without them revealing it. Some strategies that I did myself that worked were reading through the readme and rubric THOROUGHLY and really trying to focus on the basics. There was a point when I was overwhelmed with my code and decided to delete the entire block that wasn't working and go back to the basics. In doing so, I was able to debug my code step by step rather than debugging an entire block of code at once.

On that note, some things that did not work for me were trying to debug an entire block of code and only trying to work on my code in TA hours. I think I developed a dependency on the TAs and was too scared to try to code by myself because I wanted everything to be perfect the first time. I had to get over that eventually because I needed as much time as I could get and that led me to getting over that fear of making mistakes in my code.
